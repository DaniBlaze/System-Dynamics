The main objective of this paper is analyzing waste sorting behavior and the different factors which influence waste sorting behavior in practice. The reasoning behind this is to help Oslo municipality with reaching their goal, which consists of a material recycling rate of 50\% by 2030. 

\indent \newline 
The target group consists of 20-39 year old's, not coming from Asia, Africa, Latin-America and Eastern Europe outside of EU. This represents approximately 27\% of all Oslo citizens, and is adjusted for in the simulation model. This means that the model will not be able to reach a realistic material recycling rate of 50\%.

A causal loop diagram is presented in order to give an overview of the different variables and their relationships. This includes both positive and negative links on waste sorting behavior.
